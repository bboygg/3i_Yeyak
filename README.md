3i_Yeyak(Device Reservation System)
Personal project for implementing Device Reservation System for 3i, using Kubernetes, Quarkus, and Flutter



## Project Plans

### 1. Description
This project is to implement a 'Device Reservation System' for 3i company. Currently they are using Google Sheet to reserve test devices, which causes confusion and requires unnecessary time and effort. To replace this system, I will implement an app to scan devices' QR code and reserve it on a certain date & time.
